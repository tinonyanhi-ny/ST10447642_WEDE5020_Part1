      <p>NYT Vehicle Dealers was established in 2004 by Tinodaishe Nyanhi in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.
         Beginning as a modest motorcycle resale operation, it rapidly expanded into a significant pre-owned vehicle enterprise.
        In 2015, they launched their initial warehouse, growing across the country in the subsequent years.
          In 2020, Transaction Capital gained a significant share, and in 2024, NYT Vehicle Dealers was
            traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Currently, it runs over 20 branches, 
            sells upwards of 18,000 vehicles each month, and is venturing into AI-driven purchases
             and potentially new car sales</p>
